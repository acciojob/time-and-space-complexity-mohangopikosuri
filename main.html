    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity is a computational concept that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm minimizes time complexity, ensuring faster execution.
    </p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the length of the input. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates that the space requirement grows linearly with the input size.
